# Intro OpenGL
## _By Galaad Martineaux_

Things to know:

- You can move the camera on any exercises (hence why pressing 2 has no effect)
- You can also change between orthographic and perspective view in all exercises
- Lighting is enabled on the maze by default
- The white (or multicolor) cube that is displayed no matter the exercise is the light. 
When light isn't enabled, the cube will be drawn but no lighting will appear.
- Maze is at {0;0;0}, if you can't find it, spin around until you can.
- Exercise 4 reuses the scene made in the first exercise and enables lightning.
