# Intro OpenGL
By Galaad Martineaux for ISART DIGITAL.

## What is it ?
This was a project made to learn OpenGL 3's syntax, and how to work with a 3D
environment overall. This was my first real 3D project, and while not being a
game, it taught me how to control a 3D environment, and how to use math to my
advantages in three dimensions.

## Things to know:

- You can move the camera on any exercises (hence why pressing 2 has no effect)
- You can also change between orthographic and perspective view in all exercises
- Lighting is enabled on the maze by default
- The white (or multicolor) cube that is displayed no matter the exercise is the light. 
When light isn't enabled, the cube will be drawn but no lighting will appear.
- Maze is at {0;0;0}, if you can't find it, spin around until you can.
- Exercise 4 reuses the scene made in the first exercise and enables lightning.

## Known bugs

| Bug              | Explanation |
|------------------|-------------|
| PBM restrictions | PBM files can only be small |
| BMP restrictions | BMP files of certain height or width or colors won't display properly for unknown reasons. |

I wish to keep this close to what I had done back when I was at ISART DIGITAL,
as it may show my past mistakes, and how I learned from them.
